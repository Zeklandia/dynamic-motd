Login-Info-Script
=======================

Script to display basic information about the computer to which you are logging in, when you log in.

 - Date/Time
 - Hostname
 - WLAN IP Address
 - LAN IP Address
 - Kernel Version
 - Memory size
 - Current users and their stats
 - Username
 - Last login
 - Number of processes out of total allowed
 - Home directory path
 - Weather

I will be working to move this from a shell script to a Java or C program and add it to the Ubuntu repositories if I can.
